# Data Cleaning with Pandas: Email and Phone Number Consolidation

In this Python-based data cleaning project, I leveraged the Pandas library in a Jupyter Notebook to enhance a dataset's integrity and organization. The primary focus was on merging scattered email and phone number columns into dedicated fields, streamlining data presentation. Additionally, I addressed inconsistencies in the country column, transforming entries like "US" into a standardized format, such as "United States." Thorough testing and documentation were incorporated to ensure the reliability of the cleaned dataset. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook with clear instructions for implementation, making it a valuable resource for those seeking a well-structured dataset for further analysis or integration into their projects.
